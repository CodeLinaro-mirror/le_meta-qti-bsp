    # Need to create a hierarchy that works for Adreno's expectation that
    # its KERN_INCDIR variable is pointed at a directory with usr/include
    # below it with the headers.  Special casing for Adreno as opposed to
    # having to use ${STAGING_INCDIR}/X/usr/include everywhere seems like
    # a cleaner approach, and this could be removed if the Adreno makefiles
    # can be changed to just use KERN_INCDIR directly.
    # A separate hierarchy as opposed to one under ${D}/usr/include/linux-msm is
    # used to avoid issues from a symlink loop.
