SUMMARY = "Memory Hotplug"
DESCRIPTION = "During linux booting, we only leave enough memory for booting \
and remove other memory to reduce memory init time, thus linux kernel boot time. \
After linux fully boots up, this memory hotplug service needs to return all the \
removed memory back to linux."
